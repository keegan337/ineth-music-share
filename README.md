An API designed to be run in tandom with a Wordpress and MongoDB docker container. The API is hosted in an Nginx and Python 3.8 hybrid docker container. This will project will eventually be incorporated into the iNethi enviroment in Ocean View South Africa. This project is an extension of an BSc Computer Science honours level thesis completed in 2020 at the University of Cape Town. The aim is to build a music sharing system for musicians to upload on local servers (data free) and allow community members to download the music. There will be a AWS hosted global version of the website where music will also be availible for download.

Build instructions:
- Setup Wordpress and MongoDB docker containers. (soon to be added to this repository)
- Wordpress must use the WooCommerce e-commerce plugin (explanation to be added)
- More to come
